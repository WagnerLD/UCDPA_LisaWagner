    "This project's purpose is to demonstrate a specific set of competencies learned in the UCDPA Fidelity International - Data Analytics Training course.  Given I had no prior experience in data science, coding (I knew Python to be a snake and Jupyter as the 5th planet from the sun) or statistics, the learning curve was steep.  As a result, I have chosen straightforward datasets, and in some cases individual datasets to demonstrate a lone competency.  The intention is to build a strong foundation, before moving on to more complex datasets and problems, including refining my code writing skills to be succinct and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2 style=\"color:#1f5f7b;\">Introduction</h2>\n",
    "The two main datasets used through the project are \"Wine Quality\" and \"Data Science Salaries\", both chosen as I find the topics interesting and could think of various problem statements to investigate in the data.\n",
    "<pre style=\"font-family:arial;\">\n",
    "1. Wine Quality - the data is all numeric and had 11 features from which to predict the quality, this dataset was used for the Machine Learning competencies.\n",
    "2. Data Science Salaries - originally I was interested in what salary ranges exist for various qualities (title, year of experience, employee location), but in the end, the dataset chosen was more suitable for importing and data cleaning competencies.\n",
    "3. Other datasets:\n",
    "    a. Stock prices - demonstrate use of API, data merging and presenting charts on financial data\n",
    "    b. Tweets - demonstrate Regex to extract a pattern in data from text\n",

    "1. Stock Prices - prices for a stock (Visa) were being compared to a benchmark (S&P500 Index), the result showed a deep, sharp decline in the stock part way through the time period.\n",
    "    On further investigation, the stock went through a 4:1 split in the time frame the data was selected for.\n",
    "    The resulting chart (based on the original data retrieved) is not suitable to answer the problem statement, the data for the stock price will need to be restated to normalize for the stock split.\n",
    "2. Stock Prices - Once Visa's stock prices are restated to reflect the stock split, the chart more accurately shows Visa's performance compared to the benchmark (S&P500 Index).  Visa's performance was aligned to the Index until 2013 when Visa's growth was stronger than the general market.  Dips in Visa's stock price in latter years broadly correspond to dips in the Index; Visa's stock is not immune to outside conditions which impact other stocks in the Index.\n",
    "3. Wine Quality - Ridge and Lasso regression models returned poor accuracy (mid-20%), which was anticipated as the attempt to predict quality is a Classification issue.  KNN Classifier model returned better accuracy than the Regression models, but still not good (at 45%) before adjusting for outliers, simplifying target values or optimizing # of neighbors\n",
    "4. Wine Quality - Optimizing neighbors value to 25 returns a 70.4% accuracy - significantly improved from original model, but not considered a good result as model accuracy should exceed 90% to be considered useable.\n",
    "5. Wine Quality - Further fine tuning of the model did not produce any better accuracy after optimizing neighbors to 25.\n",
    "    a. Changing target values (original had a range of 3 - 9) to 0 or 1 (original quality value of <6 being \"Not Good\" = 0, >5 being \"Good\" = 1)\n",
    "    b. Outliers made up 4% of the dataset.  Removing them improved the KNN Classifer model (before target values were transformed to 1 / 0) marginally from 45% to 48%.  As expected, removing outliers had little impact on accuracy after the target values were transformed \n",
